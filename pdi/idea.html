<h1>Botty</h1>
<h5>v1.0</h5>
<h2>Short description</h2>
<p>Botty is an AI enabled chat bot that assists Dispatchers to plan Trips in PDI Logistics Cloud (PLC) application.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Currently the Dispatcher is planning Trips using PLC via drag and drop.</p>
<p>Initially the Dispatcher sees a list of available Trucks, the timeline and a list of gas stations (Customers). The
    Priority is showing how urgent a Customer needs a Product.</p>
<p>The Dispatcher decides to send a Product (or more) to a specific Customer by dragging and dropping the respective
    Customer to an available period of time shown along a specific Truck.</p>

<p>The decision to plan a specific Customer takes in consideration multiple variables: Priority, available Trucks,
    dynamic of Products consumption at Customer level and very often is influenced by the Dispatcher's flair and
    experience.</p>

<h2>Main goal</h2>
<p>Botty's ultimate goal is to replace the human Dispatcher in planning Trips.</p>

<h2>Milestones</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Helper</li>
    <li>Helper with voice</li>
    <li>Junior Assistant</li>
    <li>Spy</li>
    <li>Junior Dispatcher</li>
    <li>Intelligent Dispatcher</li>
</ul>
<h3>Helper (this project)</h3>
<p>In this stage Botty is acting more like an assistant offering help for beginner Dispatchers.</p>
<p>Botty acts more like an online help system; the human Dispatcher can type questions in a chat window and Botty
    answers these questions.</p>
<p>Examples: "How can I choose the columns I want to see for Customers?" or "How is the trend calculated?"</p>
<p>This is a continuous process, Botty must be teached new things on a regular basis.</p>
<h3>Helper with voice (this project)</h3>
<p>Botty is doing the same tasks but now he can listen and answer via voice and not only chat.</p>
<h3>Junior Assistant (this project)</h3>
<p>Botty can perform simple tasks, like "Search for Trip 123" or "I want to hide Priority column".</p>
<p>The goal for this stage is to enable Botty to plan a Trip on command ("Botty, please plan a Trip to Customer Statoil
    Tuborgvej on Truck 4303 for Monday morning."</p>
<h3>Spy (this project)</h3>
<p>This is an action Botty will do continuously and not a stage itself. It is shown here because it's absolutelly
    necessary before the next stages.</p>
<p>Spying means that Botty will save the data generated by the Dispatcher. The saving occurs anyway, but Botty will
    extract only the relevant data and save it in separate structures for easier further analysis.</p>
<p>For the scope of this project it will be enough to save the following data:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Who planned the Trip</li>
    <li>The Trip itself as it was planned, including the Trip Events and the calculated quantities</li>
    <li>The Trip as it was in its final state (after reconciliation) including all the info above</li>
    <li>The state of the Customer at the moment of planning</li>
    <li>The state of the Customer after the delivery</li>
</ul>
<h3>Junior Dispatcher (future enhancement)</h3>
<p>In this stage Botty is able to plan more and more complex Trips and asks for confirmation from the human Dispatcher.
</p>
<p>Some scores (what means a Trip is more efficient than another?) must be defined after discussions with business
    analysts and dispatchers.</p>
<p>Botty will save additionally its own proposed planning and also the adjusted Trips. He will use this as a seconday
    source for learning.</p>
<h3>Intelligent Dispatcher (future enhancement)</h3>
<p>In this stage Botty will be able to do the most work of a Dispatcher.</p>
<p>This stage must be reached as a self development from the previous stage, only by means of learning and not programming.</p>
