    <h1>ðŸ¤– PlaBot</h1>
    <h5>v1.0</h5>

    <h2>Short description</h2>
    <p>PlaBot is an AI enabled chat bot that assists Dispatchers in planning Trips in PDI Logistics Cloud (PLC) application.
    </p>

    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>Currently the Dispatcher is planning Trips using PLC via drag and drop.</p>
    <p>Initially the Dispatcher sees a list of available Trucks, the timeline and a list of gas stations (Customers).
        The
        Priority is showing how urgent a Customer needs a Product.</p>

         alt="Planning"
         style="margin: 20px">
    <p>The Dispatcher decides to send a Product (or more) to a specific Customer by drag and dropping the respective
        Customer to an available period of time shown along a specific Truck.</p>

         alt="Planned"
         style="margin: 20px">

    <p>The decision to plan a specific Customer takes in consideration multiple variables: Priority, available Trucks,
        dynamic of Products consumption at Customer level and very often is influenced by the Dispatcher's flair and
        experience.</p>

    <h2>Main goal</h2>
    <p>PlaBot's ultimate goal is to replace the human Dispatcher in planning Trips.</p>

    <h2>Details</h2>
    <p>PlaBot is basically a chat bot embedded in PLC's planning page. Initially (see bellow) it will offer help to the
        user based on text interaction, later evolving to support voice (both Speech Recognition and Text-to-speech) and
        ultimately doing the dispatcher's job of planning Trips.</p>

    <h2>Evolution</h2>
    <p>PlaBot's development stages are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Helper</li>
        <li>Helper with voice</li>
        <li>Junior Assistant</li>
        <li>Spy</li>
        <li>Junior Dispatcher</li>
        <li>Intelligent Dispatcher</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This project proposes to develop PlaBot until the Junior Dispatcher phase, making sure that it lays a foundation
        and gathers data necessary for further development.</p>

    <h3>Helper (this project)</h3>
    <p>In this stage PlaBot is acting more like an assistant offering help for beginner Dispatchers.</p>
    <p>PlaBot acts more like an online help system; the human Dispatcher can type questions in a chat window and PlaBot
        answers these questions.</p>
    <p>Examples: "How can I choose the columns I want to see for Customers?" or "How is the trend calculated?"</p>
    <p>This is a continuous process, PlaBot must be teached new things on a regular basis.</p>

    <h3>Helper with voice (this project)</h3>
    <p>PlaBot is doing the same tasks but now he can listen and answer via voice and not only chat.</p>
    <h3>Junior Assistant (this project)</h3>
    <p>PlaBot can perform simple tasks, like "Search for Trip 123" or "I want to hide Priority column".</p>
    <p>The goal for this stage is to enable PlaBot to plan a Trip on command ("PlaBot, please plan a Trip to Customer
        Statoil
        Tuborgvej on Truck 4303 for Monday morning."</p>
    <h3>Spy (this project)</h3>
    <p>This is an action PlaBot will do continuously and not a stage itself. It is shown here because it's absolutelly
        necessary before the next stages.</p>
    <p>Spying means that PlaBot will save the data generated by the Dispatcher. The saving occurs anyway, but PlaBot will
        extract only the relevant data and save it in separate structures for easier further analysis.</p>
    <p>For the scope of this project it will be enough to save the following data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Who planned the Trip</li>
        <li>The Trip itself as it was planned, including the Trip Events and the calculated quantities</li>
        <li>The Trip as it was in its final state (after reconciliation) including all the info above</li>
        <li>The state of the Customer at the moment of planning</li>
        <li>The state of the Customer after the delivery</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Junior Dispatcher (future enhancement)</h3>
    <p>In this stage PlaBot is able to plan more and more complex Trips and asks for confirmation from the human
        Dispatcher.
    </p>
    <p>Some scores (what means a Trip is more efficient than another?) must be defined after discussions with business
        analysts and dispatchers.</p>
    <p>PlaBot will save additionally its own proposed planning and also the adjusted Trips. He will use this as a
        seconday
        source for learning.</p>

        <h3>Intelligent Dispatcher (future enhancement)</h3>
    <p>In this stage PlaBot will be able to do the most work of a Dispatcher.</p>
    <p>This stage must be reached as a self development from the previous stage, only by means of learning and not
        programming.</p>

    <h2>Technologies</h2>
    <p>Will make use of the following technologies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>RiveScript</li>
        <li>JavaScript / Typescript</li>
        <li>p5.Speech</li>
        <li>.NET Core</li>
        <li>SQL Server (or Elasticsearch later)</li>
        <li>later: ML.NET / Azure / Amazon AI engines</li>
    </ul>
